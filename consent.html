                <p> TITLE OF RESEARCH: The Role of Statistical Information in Perception, Learning and
                Development </p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <p> Your son/daughter is being invited to take part in a research study. 
                    Before you decide about your child’s participation in this study, it is important that you understand why the research 
                    is being done and what it will involve. Please take the time to read the following information carefully. 
                    Please email the researcher if there is anything that is not clear or if you need more information.</p>

                

                <p><strong>Purpose of the research:</strong> The purpose of this study is to better understand how perception and learning 
                    interrelate to support lifespan development. </p>
                

                <p><strong>Study Procedures:</strong>
                    This study will take 5 minutes-20 minutes. Typically, studies are 5 minutes-20 minutes long including time 
                    for full explanation of the purpose and procedure. During this time your child may be shown different visual images 
                    either individual objects (either familiar to your child or novel), faces or other pictures 
                    (e.g., of indoor and outdoor scenes). Your child may also watch videos 
                    (e.g., TV shows, movies, or animations of objects). Your child may see these images in combination with different 
                    auditory stimuli including speech (a familiar language, a foreign language or speech sounds that you haven’t heard before), 
                    musical tones, or novel sounds (e.g., rattles and synthesizer sounds). While watching various combinations of these 
                    auditory and visual stimuli your child may be required to respond to small variations in these stimuli 
                    (e.g., if a picture is presented upside down), to respond when you see a particular stimulus 
                    (e.g., whenever you see a smiling face) or to discriminate different stimuli (e.g., is this picture familiar to you or novel?). 
                    You or your child will use your keypad, mouse, or touch screen for these responses. 
                    You may also be asked to respond verbally to the experimenter.

                    <br>
                    <em> * total expected time commitment for this study is: 5 minutes – 20 minutes</em>
                


                <p><strong>Audio Recordings:</strong>
                 Your child (and possibly you in the background) may be voice-recorded during this procedure for research purposes. 
                 Laboratory staff will review the voice recording at a later time. Audio-recording is required for participation, 
                 and your child cannot participate if you do not agree to be recorded. Audio recordings will be kept in password-protected files 
                 without any of your personal information that are only accessible to authorized researchers only. Audio recordings will collected 
                 using the platform hosting the computer task, such as LabVanced, PsychoPy, jsPsych.

                <p><strong>Benefits and Risks:</strong>
                There are no known physical or emotional risks involved in this study
                beyond those in everyday life.</p>
                

                <p><strong>Alternatives:</strong> There are no known alternatives available. </p>
                

                <p><strong>Confidentiality:</strong>
                    All records/data from this study will be kept confidential. Your child’s responses will be kept private, 
                    and we will not include any information that will make it possible to identify you or your child in any report 
                    we might publish. Research records will be stored securely on password-protected computers. 
                    The research team will be the only party that will have access to your child’s data.</p>
                
                
                <p><strong>Compensation:</strong> You will be entered into a raffle for the chance to win a $50 gift card. </p>
